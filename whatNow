Hey,

Slight problem, I have no idea how to use this! In fact, so many times I view a repository and I don't even know how to
start their app ... etc because it seems so complicated without a video. I appreciate your kindness.

PS. I had to make 3 machine learning projects for python, made a really messed up swift iphone app and took the web dev 
bootcamp thing on Udemy working with MEN (no homo). I mention this to let you know that I do try to learn - so please teach me.
